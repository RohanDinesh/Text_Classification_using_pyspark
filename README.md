# Text_Classification_using_pyspark
Huge amounts of data in today’s world are stored in the form of electronic documents. Text mining is the process of extracting the information out of those textual documents. Text classification is the process of classifying text documents into a fixed number of predefined classes. The application of text classification includes spam filtering, email routing, sentiment analysis, language identification etc. This paper discusses a detailed survey on the text classification process and various algorithms used in this field.

Text classification is one of the basic problems of text mining. Text classification is the process of assigning text documents to predefined categories based on their content. Text classification has been used in a number of application fields such as information retrieval, text filtering, electronic library and automatic web news extraction. Text classification can be achieved manually or can be automated successfully using machine learning techniques: support vector machines – SVM, tolerance rough set model approach and association rules approach. Whatever approach used, the challenge is that full-text content of documents is always taken into account so the classification process often deals with large number of features.

Traditionally, before deciding to read or buy a document (book, scientific article) we often read the abstract of this document to catch the main idea. This proves that abstract reflects the main content of document and it can be used for classifying text documents.

Nowadays, research in the field of automatic text summarization has achieved some initial successes. We can list some of the most significant works: automatic text summarization based on word-clusters and ranking algorithms, multi-document summarization by sentence extraction, inferring strategies for sentence ordering in multi-document news summarization. These methods have been applied for solving the problem of Vietnamese text summarization.

Based on the success of research in the field of automatic text summarization and the assumption that topic of text document can be simply identified through its abstract, we propose an abstract-based approach for text classification. The objective of our research is to answer the question of whether abstract should be used for classifying text documents.

In the field of data mining, the problem of text classification is often solved by using machine learning techniques: support vector machine-SVM, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor and neural network, in this project we demonstrate one such technique of text classification using a neural network model.
